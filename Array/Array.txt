What is the difference between
arr[i] - 1;
and
arr[i] = arr[i] - 1;

arr[i] -1 will display each value with -1 but no change in array but in second it does modify the array and that's what they are asking
C++ never changes data unless you explicitly assign to memory.

Expressions don’t mutate.
Assignments do.



Why does passing arr[] to a function allow modification of the original array,
but passing an int does not?

Passing an int passes a copy of the value, so changes do not affect the original.
Passing an array actually passes a pointer to its memory, so changes affect the original array.





If arrays are passed as pointers, why does sizeof(arr) inside a function not give the array size?
“Because in main it is an array, and in a function parameter it is a pointer”
